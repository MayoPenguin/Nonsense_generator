    "_One day, my CSE friend sent me a paragraph about creativity. I carefully read through it and thought it makes sense. Although this paragraph did not seems like university-level writing, the logic and the reasoning were very clear, so I thought he wrote it himself. However, later he told me actually that paragraph was generated by GPT-3 from OpenAi. I was totally shocked because it seems at that moment I cannot distinguish whom I was talking to--a person or a machine? Did it mean GPT-3 passed the Turing test?_\n",
    "\n",
    "_Initially, I wanted to make a project by using GPT-2 or GPT-3. I looked at a bunch of tutorials online about how to install it, how to train it, and how to use it to pretend to be a human. I tried my best to understand the code used in those tutorials to train the GPT model, but I can only understand a few of them. However--I really don't want to admit that--I got stuck during the installing process. It seems to actually run the GPT model need a bunch of other stuff like TensorFlow. I tried several times but still failed to install TensorFlow._\n",
    "\n",
    "_After giving up the idea about GPT model, I kept browsing Github and found an interesting project called \"BullshitGenerator\". In the Chinese version, it will generate a seemly decent essay when you input a keyword and the length. After reviewing the code, I found the logic behind this generator is very simple, and I was really inspired by the idea to use the .replace method to insert the keyword into the essay template._\n",
    "\n",
    "_I still remember that when I studied for the TOEFL test, my teacher will give me some templates to use for the writing part; and back in junior high school when I have not yet decided to study abroad, the English teacher told me that the English essays which earn a high grade in the test are essentially same. I feel that my nonsense_generator will be perfect for generating such type of essay--although it sounds incredible, under certain conditions, you will need the essay like the one generated by my nonsense_generator. Based on the project on Github, I began to improve and write my own nonsense_generator. In nonsense_generator, you can customize not only the keyword and the length but also the paragraph and the type of article you want! My purpose for this project is to generate an essay in a quick, convenient, and customized way: if you need to write 60000 words in one hour for some unreasonable requests, come to the nonsense generator! Moreover, during that process, it also requires me to explore and summarize the commonplace of human language._\n"
